# Hey, welcome to my GitHub 👋
[<img align="right" height="320" src="https://github.com/monk200/Segbot/blob/main/Demo%20Picture.PNG">](https://github.com/monk200/Segbot)

I recently graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a major in Systems Engineering and Design in the Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering college and a minor in Computer Science. I've always been interested in a variety of engineering disiplines and my degree allowed me to take courses in mechanical, electrical, and computer science topics. I used my diverse set of interests to focus in robotics and spent my last couple years of college doing some neat projects with microcontrollers, exploring how different environmental factors can affect computer vision, and learning control theory concepts.  

This GitHub is fairly new because the code I did during school wasn't organized or commented enough for me to feel proud putting it on display. I'm taking the extra time I have while searching for jobs to go through my old code and tidy it up or redo it entirely. Most repositories are centered around a class I have taken and they each have thorough README's explaining what each project worked with and output files or videos are shown whenever possible.  

To the right is my [Segbot project](https://github.com/monk200/Segbot) where I designed and programmed a two-wheeled balancing robot from the ground-up, including tuning state feedback and PID control algorithms.

## Fun Facts About Me
* My favorite author is Kurt Vonnegut
* A meme I made reached the #1 post on Reddit r/all
* The first computer I built was a Mini ITX gaming computer. He is slightly bigger than the size of a shoebox and his name is Cubert (and he's getting a little old these days 😢)
* At my peak, I was able to bench press 150lbs (which is more than I weigh!)
* I love rock climbing and have had the pleasure of teaching climbing clinics from Climbing 101 to Lead Certification
* I was once ranked 2nd globally in the game <i>I Can't Believe It's Not Gambling</i> because I wrote a clicker and ran it for all of winter break
